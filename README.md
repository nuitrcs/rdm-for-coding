# Research Data Management for Computational Research

Did you know that good data management practices can make computational research easier? Learning how to code can be challenging, but many common mistakes made by novice programmers can be avoided by using good data management practices. This workshop will cover how to make your computational projects readable by both humans and computers by organizing the script and data files in your project and formatting tabular data so that it can be easily read by R packages and Python libraries.

Slides for this workshop are included in this directory (Slides_Data_management_for_computational_research.pdf).
